# LadyCrushCrew

LadyCrushCrew is a real life climbing community for women and non-binary people, serving folks throughout California and other states in the United States. This repo is for the community landing page.

## Problem/Solution

LadyCrushCrew is a volunteer-based organization. The donations and merchandise sales from the store or at in-person events help pay for the website on Squarespace. Whether there is enough money from donations and sales, the founder will need to pay for the website. To lower the cost of the website, I decided to donate my time to create the website with the same features (about page, events page, donation page, storefront with payment method).

## Tech stack

The community page is built with JavaScript, vanilla CSS and React.
